Materials for Savio Slurm training on November 9, 2020.

The main document is `intro.html` (or `intro_slides.html` if you prefer a version that appears in slide-show format rather than as one long HTML page).

To directly view the main document on the web, simply [click here](https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-training-slurm-2020/blob/main/slurm.md).

If you're not familiar with Git or Github you can download the materials as a [zip file](https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-training-slurm-2020/archive/main.zip)

This material is also available at [https://tinyurl.com/brc-nov20](https://tinyurl.com/brc-nov20).

Ideally, participants will have a Savio account and have submitted jobs on Savio before. 

Participants not familiar with operating in a UNIX-style command-line shell environment may want to look over one of these tutorials in advance:
